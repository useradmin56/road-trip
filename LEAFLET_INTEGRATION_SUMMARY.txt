📊 DISTANCE CALCULATION EXPLAINED:
================================================================================

HAVERSINE FORMULA
────────────────
• Calculates distance on a sphere (Earth)
• Accurate for straight-line distances
• Formula: d = R × c
  Where:
    R = Earth's radius (6,371 km)
    c = angular distance
• Accuracy: Within 0.5% of actual

WHAT'S CALCULATED
────────────────
1. GPS Point to Point
   • As you drive and track location
   • Distance between consecutive GPS points
   • Sum = Total distance traveled
   • Shown in "Journey Summary"

2. Stop to Stop
   • Distance between planned stops
   • Straight line on map
   • Shown in stops list
   • Sum = Total route distance

3. Current Position
   • Real-time total as you drive
   • Updates with each new GPS point
   • Shown in "Current Location" info

IMPORTANT NOTE
─────────────
• Haversine = STRAIGHT LINE distance
• Actual ROAD distance is 10-15% more
• Why? Roads curve, have turns, elevation
• Use GPS tracking (not just stops) for accuracy
• Compare with car odometer to see difference

EXAMPLE
───────
Delhi to Mumbai:
  Haversine: 1,138 km (straight line)
  Road (NH48): 1,400 km (actual driving)
  Difference: 262 km (23%)

With GPS tracking every 30 seconds:
  Tracked: 1,385 km (follows roads)
  Actual: 1,400 km (car odometer)
  Difference: 15 km (1%) - Much more accurate!

🎨 VISUAL EXAMPLES:
================================================================================

SCENARIO 1: Daily Commute
─────────────────────────
Start tracking → Drive to work → Stop tracking

Map shows:
• Blue line from home to office
• Multiple blue dots (GPS points every 30 seconds)
• Distance: e.g., 15.3 km
• Time: Start and end timestamps

SCENARIO 2: Road Trip with Stops
────────────────────────────────
Plan stops → Track journey → View on map

Map shows:
• Green dashed line: Planned route (stops 1→2→3→4)
• Blue solid line: Actual path driven
• Both lines visible for comparison
• Can see detours, diversions

SCENARIO 3: Fuel Efficiency Check
─────────────────────────────────
Note km at refill → Drive → Note km at next refill

Data shows:
• GPS distance: 250 km
• Odometer difference: 263 km
• Difference: 13 km (5%) - normal variance
• Fuel used: 18 L
• Efficiency: 250 ÷ 18 = 13.9 km/L (GPS)
• Efficiency: 263 ÷ 18 = 14.6 km/L (Odometer)

================================================================================

💡 BEST PRACTICES:
================================================================================

FOR ACCURATE DISTANCE TRACKING:
──────────────────────────────
1. Use "Start Tracking" for continuous monitoring
2. Track outdoors for best GPS signal
3. Compare GPS distance with odometer
4. Add 10-15% to GPS for road distance estimate
5. Export data regularly for backup

FOR ROUTE PLANNING:
──────────────────
1. Add stops in order of travel
2. Use "Use Current Location" when at the place
3. Or get coordinates from Google Maps beforehand
4. View planned route before starting trip
5. Note total planned distance

FOR DIESEL TRACKING:
───────────────────
1. Record odometer at each refill
2. Add stop at gas station with coordinates
3. Track location between refills
4. Compare GPS distance with odometer
5. Calculate: Distance ÷ Liters = km/L

FOR EXPENSE MANAGEMENT:
──────────────────────
1. Add stops at expense locations
2. Record expense with location
3. Track where money is spent
4. Plan budget for each stop
5. Compare total expenses with contributions
