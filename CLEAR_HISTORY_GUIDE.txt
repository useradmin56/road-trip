🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING:
================================================================================

ISSUE: Button doesn't work
SOLUTION:
✓ Refresh page (Ctrl+R)
✓ Make sure on "Live Location" tab
✓ Check browser console (F12) for errors

ISSUE: Cleared by accident
SOLUTION:
✗ Cannot undo from app
✓ If exported before: Import the JSON file
✓ Otherwise: Data is lost

ISSUE: "Remove Last Point" removes wrong point
SOLUTION:
✓ It removes the most recent (latest timestamp)
✓ Check journey summary to see order
✓ Points are ordered by time, not map position

ISSUE: Cleared history but route still shows
SOLUTION:
✓ This is correct behavior
✓ Route (green line) is separate from history (blue line)
✓ Use "Clear Route" to remove green line
✓ Use "Clear History" to remove blue line

ISSUE: Want to clear some points in middle
SOLUTION:
✗ Cannot selectively clear middle points
✓ Can only remove from end (last point)
✓ Or clear all and re-track
