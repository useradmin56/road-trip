# 📁 Tour Management System - Modular Structure

## ✨ What Changed?

Your Tour Management System has been reorganized into **separate, modular files** for better organization and maintainability!

---

## 📂 New File Structure

### **Main Application Files:**
- `index.html` - Main application interface
- `styles.css` - All styling
- `script.js` - Core logic and coordination

### **Feature Modules (NEW!):**
- ⭐ `family-members.js` - Family member management
- ⭐ `location-tracking.js` - GPS and map functionality

### **Configuration:**
- `supabase-config.js` - Cloud storage integration

### **Dashboard:**
- `dashboard.html` - Analytics and reporting

### **Documentation:**
- `MODULE_STRUCTURE_GUIDE.txt` - Complete module documentation
- `FAMILY_MEMBERS_GUIDE.txt` - Family features guide
- `DASHBOARD_GUIDE.txt` - Dashboard usage guide
- And more...

---

## 🎯 Module Purposes

### 1. **family-members.js** - Family Management
Handles everything related to family members:
- ✅ Dynamic member count (ask "how many members?")
- ✅ Generate forms for each member
- ✅ Collect name + mobile number
- ✅ Validate inputs (10-digit mobile)
- ✅ Track contributions
- ✅ Populate dropdowns
- ✅ Display member summaries

**Functions Exported:**
```javascript
- initFamilyMembers()
- populateMemberSelects()
- initContributionForm()
- displayContributions()
```

### 2. **location-tracking.js** - GPS & Maps
Handles everything related to location and mapping:
- ✅ Leaflet map initialization
- ✅ GPS tracking (start/stop)
- ✅ Location permissions
- ✅ Distance calculations
- ✅ Route visualization
- ✅ Location history
- ✅ Clear tracking points

**Functions Exported:**
```javascript
- initMap()
- initLocationTracking()
- calculateDistance()
- calculateTotalDistance()
- updateRouteSummary()
- displayLocationHistory()
```

## 🔗 How It Works

```
Browser Opens index.html
    ↓
Loads Scripts in Order:
    1. Leaflet (map library)
    2. jsPDF (PDF generation)
    3. supabase-config.js (cloud)
    4. family-members.js (exports functions)
    5. location-tracking.js (exports functions)
    6. script.js (coordinates all modules)
    ↓
Modules Export Functions:
    window.familyMembersModule = {...}
    window.locationTrackingModule = {...}
    ↓
Main Script Calls Module Functions:
    if (window.familyMembersModule) {
        window.familyMembersModule.initFamilyMembers();
    }
```

- Update location features? → Edit `location-tracking.js`
- No searching through 2000+ lines!

### 3. **Faster Development**
- Work on specific modules
- Less code conflicts
- Cleaner codebase

### 4. **Code Reusability**
- Modules can be reused in other projects
- Plug-and-play functionality
