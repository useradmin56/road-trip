## üì± Browser Location Permission

### How Location Permission Works

   - ‚ùå May not work: `http://yoursite.com`
   - ‚úÖ Exception: `file:///` (local files) usually work

2. **Permission States**:
   - **Not Asked**: Browser hasn't requested permission yet
   - **Granted**: You can use location features ‚úÖ
   - **Denied**: User rejected or blocked location access ‚ùå

### If Location Permission is Denied

**Chrome:**
1. Click the üîí or ‚ìò icon in the address bar
2. Find "Location" setting
3. Change to "Allow"
4. Refresh the page

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Enable Location Permission" button doesn't work

**Solutions:**
- Ensure you're not in Incognito/Private mode (some browsers block location)
- Check if location services are enabled on your device
- Try a different browser
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Make sure your device has location services turned on (Settings > Location)

### Problem: Map shows "For development purposes only"

**Solution:**
- This means Google Maps API key is not set or invalid
- Get a valid API key from Google Cloud Console
- **Alternative**: Use the "Enable Embed Map" feature which doesn't need an API key!

### Problem: Embedded map doesn't load

**Solutions:**
- Check your internet connection
- Make sure you've clicked "Get Current Location" first
- Try clicking "Enable Embed Map" again
- Clear browser cache

### Problem: Location is inaccurate

**Solutions:**
- Use "High Accuracy" mode (already enabled in the app)
- Move to an area with better GPS signal
- Try on a mobile device (better GPS)
- Wait a few seconds for GPS to lock on

---

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### For Best Location Accuracy:
1. **Use Mobile Devices**: Phones have better GPS than laptops
2. **Go Outside**: GPS works better outdoors
3. **Wait for Lock**: First location may be inaccurate, wait 10-20 seconds
4. **High Accuracy Mode**: Already enabled in the app

### For Data Privacy:
- All location data is stored **locally in your browser**
- No data is sent to any server (except Google Maps for displaying the map)
- You can clear all location history by clearing localStorage
- Location tracking only works when you enable it

### For Trip Documentation:
1. **Start tracking** at the beginning of your trip
2. Locations are automatically saved every 30 seconds
3. View **Location History** to see your complete journey
4. Export data regularly for backup
