# üó∫Ô∏è Leaflet Maps & Route Calculation Guide

## Overview

Your Tour Management System now uses **Leaflet** - a powerful, lightweight, open-source mapping library! This provides offline-capable maps with automatic route calculation and distance tracking for your car trips.

---

## üéâ Key Features

### ‚úÖ **No API Key Required!**
- Unlike Google Maps, Leaflet works without any API keys
- Uses OpenStreetMap for map tiles
- Completely free and open-source

### üìè **Automatic Distance Calculation**
- **Haversine Formula**: Calculates accurate distances between GPS coordinates
- Real-time distance tracking as you travel
- Distance shown between consecutive stops
- Total route distance automatically calculated

### üó∫Ô∏è **Interactive Map Features**
- **Blue Line**: Your actual travel path (location history)
- **Green Dashed Line**: Planned route through stops
- **Numbered Markers**: Your planned stops (1, 2, 3...)
- **Blue Dots**: Individual location points
- **Red Pin**: Current location

### üìç **Route Planning**
- Add stops with coordinates
- Use "My Current Location" button for automatic coordinates
- View each stop on the map
- Calculate total route distance
- Export route data

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Open the Application
Simply open `index.html` in your browser - Leaflet loads automatically from your local `leaflet/dist/` folder!

### Step 2: Enable Location
1. Go to **"Live Location"** tab
2. Click **"Enable Location Permission"**
3. Allow location access in browser

### Step 3: Start Tracking
1. Click **"Get Current Location"** to see where you are
2. The map shows your position with a red marker
3. Your coordinates and location accuracy appear below the map

### Step 4: Add Route Stops
1. Go to **"Route & Stops"** tab
2. Fill in stop details:
   - **Stop Name**: e.g., "Rest Stop", "Delhi Gate"
   - **Location**: Address or place name
   - **Latitude & Longitude**: GPS coordinates
3. Click **"Use My Current Location"** to auto-fill coordinates
4. Click **"Add Stop"**

### Step 5: View Your Route
1. Go back to **"Live Location"** tab
2. See your planned route drawn on the map (green dashed line)
3. **Route Information** panel shows:
   - Total Distance in kilometers
   - Number of route points

---

## üìè Distance Calculation

### How It Works

The app uses the **Haversine Formula** to calculate distances between GPS coordinates:

```javascript
Distance = Earth_Radius √ó arccos(
    sin(lat1) √ó sin(lat2) + 
    cos(lat1) √ó cos(lat2) √ó cos(lon2 - lon1)
)
```

### What Gets Calculated

1. **Location History Distance**
   - Distance between each GPS point as you travel
   - Shown in "Journey Summary" in Location History
   - Updates automatically with each new location point

2. **Stop-to-Stop Distance**
   - Distance between planned stops
   - Shown in stops list as "Distance from previous"
   - Total route distance displayed at the top

3. **Current Location to Stop**
   - When you view a stop on the map
   - Helps you know how far to next destination

### Accuracy
- **Road Distance**: ~10-15% longer than straight-line distance
- **GPS Accuracy**: Typically 5-20 meters
- **Calculation Accuracy**: Within 0.5% of actual distance

## üîß Tips & Best Practices

### For Accurate Distance Tracking

1. **Enable High Accuracy**
   - Already enabled in the app
   - Uses GPS + WiFi + cell towers
   - More accurate but uses more battery

2. **Track Outdoors**
   - GPS works best with clear sky view
   - May not work well in tunnels or parking garages

3. **Regular Updates**
   - Start tracking at beginning of trip
   - Records location every 30 seconds
   - More points = more accurate distance

4. **Add Stops at Key Points**
   - Gas stations (for fuel tracking)
   - Rest stops
   - Major cities
   - Toll plazas

### For Route Planning

1. **Get Coordinates Beforehand**
   - Use Google Maps to find lat/lng:
     - Right-click on location
     - Click coordinates to copy
     - Paste into stop form

2. **Use Consistent Format**
   - Latitude: -90 to 90
   - Longitude: -180 to 180
   - Decimals: 4-6 places is enough

3. **Plan in Order**
   - Add stops in the sequence you'll visit
   - Makes the route line make sense
   - Easier to calculate total distance

4. **Combine with Driver Data**
   - Note kilometer reading at each stop
   - Compare with calculated distance
   - Track fuel efficiency (km per liter)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Map Not Showing

**Problem:** Blank gray area where map should be

**Solutions:**
1. Check internet connection (needed for map tiles)
2. Check browser console for errors (F12)
3. Ensure `leaflet/dist/` folder exists with files
4. Refresh the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)

### Inaccurate Distances

**Problem:** Calculated distance doesn't match car odometer

**Explanation:**
- Leaflet calculates **straight-line distance**
- Roads curve, have turns, elevation changes
- Actual road distance is usually 10-15% more

**Example:**
```
Straight-line: 100 km
Actual road: 110-115 km
```

### Location Not Updating

**Problem:** Current location not changing

**Solutions:**
1. Click "Get Current Location" manually
2. Check if location permission is granted
3. Go outdoors for better GPS signal
4. Restart browser/clear cache

### Route Not Showing

**Problem:** Green route line not appearing

**Reasons:**
1. No stops added yet ‚Üí Add at least 2 stops
2. Stops missing coordinates ‚Üí Add lat/lng for each stop
3. Map not initialized ‚Üí Refresh page

### Wrong Coordinates

**Problem:** Stop appears in wrong location

**Solutions:**
1. Double-check lat/lng values
2. Ensure latitude is first, longitude second
3. Use "Use Current Location" if you're there
4. Get coordinates from Google Maps:
   - Right-click location ‚Üí Copy coordinates
